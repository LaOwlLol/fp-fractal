# fp-fractal
Fractal Generator

A simple fractal viewer.

Try populate without adjusting the values.
Then try something like:

Min-X: -1.45
Max-X: -1.42
Min Y: -0.01
Max Y: 0.01

Then increase the escape value little by little. (past 150 the larger Mandelbrot reappears!)

Zoom by adjusting the values.

It's best to keep x min and x max 3 apart (zoom 10x by making it 0.3, 0.03 ... and so on) 

For y keep the min and max 1 apart (zoom 10x with 0.1, 0.01 ... and so on)

Larger escape values take longer to compute. But unless you are zoomed in super far its 'better' at low values.
